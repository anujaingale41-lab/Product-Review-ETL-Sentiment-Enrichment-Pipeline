0,B0D1XD1ZV3,5.0,positive,"I've owned multiple pairs of AirPods over the years—standard, Pro, and even the Max version. Up until now, my favorite had always been the first-generation AirPods Pro. But after debating whether or not to get the second-generation AirPods Pro, I finally took the plunge, and I’m glad I did. Here’s what I’ve noticed after using them.The biggest improvement I noticed right away was the noise cancellation. I spend a lot of time in loud environments, whether it's in a workshop or just crowded spaces, and the V2’s ANC works much better at filtering out background noise. There’s also this new feature where it seems to adjust based on voices around you, something that wasn’t in the first version. It’s made a noticeable difference when I need to focus or block out distractions.In terms of sound, I wouldn’t say it’s a night-and-day difference, but the bass feels more punchy in this new version. The sound is crisper overall, but unless you’re really paying attention, the upgrade might seem subtle.One of the best things about the AirPods Pro (V2) is the improvement in battery life. I’m getting almost double the usage time compared to the first-gen. Plus, Apple finally switched to USB-C charging, which feels long overdue. The wireless charging has also been more reliable—no more overheating or endless charging cycles like I had with the older model.Something I always look for in Apple products is quality, and I’m happy to report that it’s still there. These AirPods feel sturdy, and they work flawlessly with my other Apple devices. Pairing them is almost instant, and the upgraded FindMy feature has been a lifesaver. The fact that the charging case can now make a noise when lost is incredibly useful—something the previous model didn’t offer, which was a frustrating limitation.AppleCare+ remains as good as ever, and I continue to recommend it for all Apple products. This time around, they’ve made it simpler by offering an option to bundle it directly with the purchase, so you don’t have to activate it later on. It saves you the hassle, and it ensures that you're covered from day one.For me, the most crucial factor is how much I use these. I wear my AirPods a lot—whether I’m listening to music or just using them for noise cancellation during daily tasks. If you’re like me and have these in your ears for hours on end, the V2 is absolutely worth the upgrade. But if you’re not using them constantly, you might want to hold off for the next version that’s likely coming soon.In conclusion, while the second-generation AirPods Pro might not be a massive leap in sound quality for the average listener, the combination of better noise cancellation, battery life, and new features make it a solid upgrade. For regular users like me, it's definitely worth the investment, but casual users might be just fine sticking with their current pair.",483,0,ive owned multiple pairs of airpods over the yearsstandard pro and even the max version up until now my favorite had always been the firstgeneration airpods pro but after debating whether or not to get the secondgeneration airpods pro i finally took the plunge and im glad i did heres what ive noticed after using themthe biggest improvement i noticed right away was the noise cancellation i spend a lot of time in loud environments whether its in a workshop or just crowded spaces and the v2s anc works much better at filtering out background noise theres also this new feature where it seems to adjust based on voices around you something that wasnt in the first version its made a noticeable difference when i need to focus or block out distractionsin terms of sound i wouldnt say its a nightandday difference but the bass feels more punchy in this new version the sound is crisper overall but unless youre really paying attention the upgrade might seem subtleone of the best things about the airpods pro v2 is the improvement in battery life im getting almost double the usage time compared to the firstgen plus apple finally switched to usbc charging which feels long overdue the wireless charging has also been more reliableno more overheating or endless charging cycles like i had with the older modelsomething i always look for in apple products is quality and im happy to report that its still there these airpods feel sturdy and they work flawlessly with my other apple devices pairing them is almost instant and the upgraded findmy feature has been a lifesaver the fact that the charging case can now make a noise when lost is incredibly usefulsomething the previous model didnt offer which was a frustrating limitationapplecare remains as good as ever and i continue to recommend it for all apple products this time around theyve made it simpler by offering an option to bundle it directly with the purchase so you dont have to activate it later on it saves you the hassle and it ensures that youre covered from day onefor me the most crucial factor is how much i use these i wear my airpods a lotwhether im listening to music or just using them for noise cancellation during daily tasks if youre like me and have these in your ears for hours on end the v2 is absolutely worth the upgrade but if youre not using them constantly you might want to hold off for the next version thats likely coming soonin conclusion while the secondgeneration airpods pro might not be a massive leap in sound quality for the average listener the combination of better noise cancellation battery life and new features make it a solid upgrade for regular users like me its definitely worth the investment but casual users might be just fine sticking with their current pair
1,B0D1XD1ZV3,5.0,positive,"First, please comment if you have any questions and I would love to respond to help!I had the AirPods Pro Gen1 prior to these, but the new AirPods blew them out of the water. The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.The Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.The battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.I personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.As an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. The AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, descrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.The AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.Long story short, if you’re on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.Hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!",407,1,first please comment if you have any questions and i would love to respond to helpi had the airpods pro gen1 prior to these but the new airpods blew them out of the water the added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like minethe active noise cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of adaptive audio is super cool and very usefulthe battery is even better than i was expecting the airpods charge super fast in the case and the case charging itself is also super fast the usbc cord is a very nice addition especially with the new more common usbc charging block the new apple braided usbc cord is also a small but nice touchi personally do not use the ring on the side but i imagine many people may find it useful the addition of the find my capabilities with both the case and the airpods themselves is beyond helpful because i always seem to misplace them small bonus every time you charge the case or the airpods the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is lowas an owner of the airpods max and a former owner of the airpods pro gen 1 i would 100 recommend this new generation the noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1 but slightly behind the maxes because they are inear instead of overear if you want the maxes i would get them but it depends on your activities the airpods pro are ideal because they are small descrete and light weight you can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear they are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out as opposed to the maxesthe airpods are quite durable too if my first pair is any indication to this pair then i promise you they can take a beating after 4 years of having the first gen airpods pro i have thrown them around dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces but they worked every single timelong story short if youre on the fence get them they are super great for travel workoutsruns house chores and all activities in generalhope you find this helpful if you have any questions please comment them
2,B0D1XD1ZV3,5.0,positive,"I've owned all versions of airpods, normal, pro, max, etc. My favorite one for the longest time was the Airpod Pros ""version 1"". This product is the Airpods Pro ""version 2"". It took me a while to convince myself to buy these, but after testing both side-by-side I noticed a few very noticeable features.*ANC is improved. I can say this with certainty. I work hobbies that at times involve loud machinery and fellas yelling at each other. I can tell the difference in the ANC ""level"". It simply works better than before and it has this additional thing that detects vocal conversations and adapts- the V1 pros didn't have that.*Sound quality is minorly improved - I have pretty good ears, and the bass sounds a bit better with these. Unfortunately, that's about all I can say about that.*Battery and compatibility vastly improved; USB-C Charging has been long overdue. The wireless charging works better than v1 too- v1 heats up quite a bit and seems to charge endlessly using the official wireless apple charger. V2 doesn't have that issue. The batteries in the case and pods are nearly 2x better from what I am seeing so far.*Quality hasn't declined; This one is important to me. I buy apple products mainly because of their build quality and how well they operate with each other. These pair nearly effortlessly with the iPhone, and the FindMy function has VASTLY improved; Making the case able to produce a sound to locate with has been a game changer. Previously with the older Airpod Pros, if you lost them while in the case, you couldn't locate them with the find-my app because they had no way to produce a noise whilst in the case. I am so glad they improved upon this quality aspect and the Airpod's quality continues to rise without noticeable compromises.*AppleCare+: Nothing has really changed about this and that's a good thing. AppleCare+ works well, and I recommend it. I use it on all of my apple devices. I was happy to see that they made it even easier than before to get AppleCare+ bundled with the actual purchase of the airpods. Before, you had to manually activate it and that was a bit inconvienent. Plus people would forget they had AppleCare and leave their device unprotected because they didn't activate it. Glad to hear they addressed all that as well.*Lasting technology: My final point is most important to me. I could ramble on and on about this part but long story short- I use these ALL the time, and I'm not joking- around 60-75% of the time I have these in, even without music playing. If you're the type of person who uses these a lot, then going from V1 to V2 is a no-brainer. But if you do NOT use them constantly like I do, don't worry! That's probably good for you and if you're not tethered to them like I am, then you should probably wait for the newer ""v3"" ones that are coming out sometime next year.The Airpod Pro's v2 might not be an impressive upgrade for audiophiles, but for almost everyone else the extra bells & whistles make up for the marginally improved sound quality and make it worth the extra cost.",543,1,ive owned all versions of airpods normal pro max etc my favorite one for the longest time was the airpod pros version 1 this product is the airpods pro version 2 it took me a while to convince myself to buy these but after testing both sidebyside i noticed a few very noticeable featuresanc is improved i can say this with certainty i work hobbies that at times involve loud machinery and fellas yelling at each other i can tell the difference in the anc level it simply works better than before and it has this additional thing that detects vocal conversations and adapts the v1 pros didnt have thatsound quality is minorly improved i have pretty good ears and the bass sounds a bit better with these unfortunately thats about all i can say about thatbattery and compatibility vastly improved usbc charging has been long overdue the wireless charging works better than v1 too v1 heats up quite a bit and seems to charge endlessly using the official wireless apple charger v2 doesnt have that issue the batteries in the case and pods are nearly 2x better from what i am seeing so farquality hasnt declined this one is important to me i buy apple products mainly because of their build quality and how well they operate with each other these pair nearly effortlessly with the iphone and the findmy function has vastly improved making the case able to produce a sound to locate with has been a game changer previously with the older airpod pros if you lost them while in the case you couldnt locate them with the findmy app because they had no way to produce a noise whilst in the case i am so glad they improved upon this quality aspect and the airpods quality continues to rise without noticeable compromisesapplecare nothing has really changed about this and thats a good thing applecare works well and i recommend it i use it on all of my apple devices i was happy to see that they made it even easier than before to get applecare bundled with the actual purchase of the airpods before you had to manually activate it and that was a bit inconvienent plus people would forget they had applecare and leave their device unprotected because they didnt activate it glad to hear they addressed all that as welllasting technology my final point is most important to me i could ramble on and on about this part but long story short i use these all the time and im not joking around 6075 of the time i have these in even without music playing if youre the type of person who uses these a lot then going from v1 to v2 is a nobrainer but if you do not use them constantly like i do dont worry thats probably good for you and if youre not tethered to them like i am then you should probably wait for the newer v3 ones that are coming out sometime next yearthe airpod pros v2 might not be an impressive upgrade for audiophiles but for almost everyone else the extra bells whistles make up for the marginally improved sound quality and make it worth the extra cost
3,B0D1XD1ZV3,5.0,positive,"Purchased Airpods Pro 2 with USB-C on Amazon.  I started a return second day because of Bluetooth issues but received support and reset my AirPods. AirPods Pro 2 works seamlessly.ANC: Much improved  superior ANC than AirPods Pro. Sound reduction appears to be 35 decibels, which means if your environment is very loud, for example, listening to a jackhammer around 103 decibels, which can impair your hearing, the AirPods pro 2 may reduce the noise by 35 decibels.  I also own the AirPods Pro also purchased on Amazon and can attest noise canceling is great on AirPods Pro2.Connectivity: Seamless Bluetooth connectionSeal:  Apple included extra small ear tips as well as three larger sizes. Seal is nearly soundproof. Much improved over AirPods Pro.Design and Weight:  Same as AirPod Pro but very lightweight and comfortable. I fell asleep with my AirPods Pro 2 and didn't know I was wearing my AirPods. The magsafe charging case can charge wirelessly.Battery Life:  Much improved over AirPods Pro which lasted about 4.5 hours on ANC mode.  I calculated the AirPods Pro 2 to last beyond 6 hours with ANC.Features:  Fortunately I am not hearing impaired but for those who are, may appreciate AirPods Pro 2 can be used as hearing aids with a hearing test soon to come since Apple has not launched a software update.  The device has hearing protection.  It has adaptive hearing, transparency mode, conversational mode, adaptive EQ,  voice isolation, 4.5 hours talk time. It is dust, sweat, and water resistant (IP54).  It also has up to 4 hours of Lossless Audio listening time on a single charge with Apple Vision Pro. 5 minutes charging in case may provide up to an hour listening time. Mag safe case can provide up to 30 hours of listening time15 and up to 24 hours of talk time.Sound: Fairly robust.  I would have preferred richer bass, but overall a great product.

5,B0D1XD1ZV3,5.0,positive,"Okay so I’m an Apple mark. All Apple all the time, the way everything works together just makes the part of my brain that demands product harmony feel good. But I have never been an earbuds guy. I’ve been a regular AirPods guy, specifically not the Pros.I didn’t like things sticking in my ear, I’d never found one that works. And stupidly, my stupid reason for trying these is because of the USB C/Magsafe charging case because I’m trying to phase out my Lightning-charging devices. Guys I am unwell, okay? But stick with me a moment here. I also liked that the case is trackable in Find My along with the pods themselves, I’ve become a big Find My guy recently so that tickles my fancy.So anyway I bought a pair of 3rd gen AirPods and they’re very good but largely the same as my old 2nds. So I figured hey, I’ll try the Pro 2s and worst case I return them.I will not be returning them.Popped em in, did the setup, and some of this is because I’ve never had good noise cancelling headphones but I was sitting 7 feet from my furnace earlier and could not hear the fan. Popped one out, hella loud fan. Back in, silence. Witchcraft, sorcery.Sound quality is fabulous, I’m listening to Mint Jams by Casiopea right now because of that Reddit meme about the guy buying a record from Japan and it sounds so great. Holy Diver by Dio kicks ass, Kickstart My Heart puts your head right in Tommy Lee’s…drum kit. You could tell me they’re not audiophile quality or whatever and I’m sure you’re right but songs I’ve heard 1000 times sound like so much more wearing these.It also comes with four different size eartips, and what I’ve discovered about myself is my problem has been with the size of them. Medium didn’t feel like they were in all the way. Small was a little better, went down to extra small and I can finally wear in-ear earbuds. Ordered two replacement sets because I can see where white eartips might get gross quickly.So anyway, buy these AirPods. Connection is seamless with your Apple devices. They work great, they look good if you like AirPods. I find them very comfortable, battery life is probably fine but I haven’t gotten that far yet.

8,B0D1XD1ZV3,5.0,positive,"For the most part, the Airpod Pro earbuds do a decent job of staying in (versus the last two iterations that wouldn't stay in if I happened to look in any direction other than forward). But, there was still that feeling and doubt that made me worry that they may fall out for whatever reason.After looking for weeks to find something that would work (including some that apparently caused some of the functionality of the earbuds to not work because it covered it up), these popped up. I was hesitant b/c it seemed so new and there were so few reviews, but in the end, figured if it worked, great! If not, then that would be reflected in this review. Ultimately, I'm happy to report that they work exactly like they should, minus a single flaw that can be overlooked, if you're willing to deal with the slight inconvenience.The package arrived (thank you, Prime!) quickly, and the box looks like any box that would contain these sorts of things. I don't know, there's nothing special to report there. What's nice is that they include 3 pairs (all the same size) that fit very snugly over each earbud, and each cover does NOT...cover...the little black, whatever-they-are-they-look-like-vents.Airpod functionality is not affected as they still pause when you take them out of your ears. The stems are obviously not affected, and once they're in your ears, they do a good job of holding the Airpod in place (despite some extremely vigorous headshaking)I have only two requests for future versions of these:1. Make different size ""wing"" tips. Mine fit ok, and the tip doesn't push too hard into the ear; just enough to hold the earbud in place.2. The case doesn't close when you put the earbuds into the charging case.#1 would just be nice. As far as #2 is concerned, however, that cannot be helped. The Airpod Pros are not designed to have any add-ons as they would interfere with the case closing. I tried giving it a squeeze to close the case (very gently), but no dice. You'll just have to pop them off, but they come off so quickly and easily that it shouldn't be a problem. I'd recommend getting a case for your Airpod Pros (yes, a case for the case), and store the additional earbud tips that way.Overall, I'm very satisfied with these. I've paired these with some memory foam tips to get a better seal as well. Not necessary, but it helps. Anyway, great purchase and great item!TL;DRPros- Does not interfere with primary functionality- Keeps each earbud very secure in the ear (YMMV)- Easy to pop on and off each earbud- Comes in three pairs in case you lose any of themCons- Can't close the case with them on- Tips are only one size",466,1,for the most part the airpod pro earbuds do a decent job of staying in versus the last two iterations that wouldnt stay in if i happened to look in any direction other than forward but there was still that feeling and doubt that made me worry that they may fall out for whatever reasonafter looking for weeks to find something that would work including some that apparently caused some of the functionality of the earbuds to not work because it covered it up these popped up i was hesitant bc it seemed so new and there were so few reviews but in the end figured if it worked great if not then that would be reflected in this review ultimately im happy to report that they work exactly like they should minus a single flaw that can be overlooked if youre willing to deal with the slight inconveniencethe package arrived thank you prime quickly and the box looks like any box that would contain these sorts of things i dont know theres nothing special to report there whats nice is that they include 3 pairs all the same size that fit very snugly over each earbud and each cover does notcoverthe little black whatevertheyaretheylooklikeventsairpod functionality is not affected as they still pause when you take them out of your ears the stems are obviously not affected and once theyre in your ears they do a good job of holding the airpod in place despite some extremely vigorous headshakingi have only two requests for future versions of these1 make different size wing tips mine fit ok and the tip doesnt push too hard into the ear just enough to hold the earbud in place2 the case doesnt close when you put the earbuds into the charging case1 would just be nice as far as 2 is concerned however that cannot be helped the airpod pros are not designed to have any addons as they would interfere with the case closing i tried giving it a squeeze to close the case very gently but no dice youll just have to pop them off but they come off so quickly and easily that it shouldnt be a problem id recommend getting a case for your airpod pros yes a case for the case and store the additional earbud tips that wayoverall im very satisfied with these ive paired these with some memory foam tips to get a better seal as well not necessary but it helps anyway great purchase and great itemtldrpros does not interfere with primary functionality keeps each earbud very secure in the ear ymmv easy to pop on and off each earbud comes in three pairs in case you lose any of themcons cant close the case with them on tips are only one size
9,B0D1XD1ZV3,5.0,positive,"I have abstained from buying air pods because I still remember what garbage the wired version was.

Not only do they fit me well, they also come with multiple sizes for different ears and, using the app(it will be a new option in your iPhone settings), can test quickly and easily to figure out which size is the right fit.In my opinion, these are pretty lightweight and often I don’t even notice that I have them in, especially combined with the immersion of Spatial Audio.Price wise, they’ve been on sale for around the same price as my last Skullcandy ear buds when the model was new, the Indy ANC, but holy cow, these AirPod pro 2 buds blow them out of the water in every way.The integration with iPhone is impressive, they can even sense when you put them in your ears so it can transfer the sound at the right time without missing anything or pause your music if you remove one.The sound upgrade for me is pretty incredible and I really like how I can listen to these for hours without feeling deafened with a compressed head after.These really have so many cool features vs other headphones I’ve had that I could easily write an essay on them, but this is already tldrIf you made it this far, my one tip is to make sure to get into the settings and turn on fixed Spatial Audio as it isn’t on by default.",289,0,i have abstained from buying air pods because i still remember what garbage the wired version was hard plastic just doesnt work for my ear holes so ive been using skullcandy since the wired days however amazon had a great sale on these with same day delivery and i was feeling a little hypo so i got them and they feel great not only do they fit me well they also come with multiple sizes for different ears and using the appit will be a new option in your iphone settings can test quickly and easily to figure out which size is the right fitin my opinion these are pretty lightweight and often i dont even notice that i have them in especially combined with the immersion of spatial audioprice wise theyve been on sale for around the same price as my last skullcandy ear buds when the model was new the indy anc but holy cow these airpod pro 2 buds blow them out of the water in every waythe integration with iphone is impressive they can even sense when you put them in your ears so it can transfer the sound at the right time without missing anything or pause your music if you remove onethe sound upgrade for me is pretty incredible and i really like how i can listen to these for hours without feeling deafened with a compressed head afterthese really have so many cool features vs other headphones ive had that i could easily write an essay on them but this is already tldrif you made it this far my one tip is to make sure to get into the settings and turn on fixed spatial audio as it isnt on by default
